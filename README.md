# random-py-utils

Just a collection of random Python scripts.  

For CPU & GPU alerts, you need *OpenHardwareMonitor* installed and up and running (with admin rights) before executing. You also need `wmi` and `pywin32` installed.  

Note that the author of this repo does not accept any responsibility for personal and/or collective damage done by using these scripts.  

They involve using passwords and e-mail data.  

Even though passwords are handled by `getpass`, there may be other security risks involved. Users should familiarise themselves with the libraries included and take overall responsibility for the execution of scripts.
